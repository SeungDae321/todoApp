# todoApp
create list
update list
delete list
no need to make read list because it`s instantly read the created list; (or maybe I should add date info of each list -when was this created && deleted);

todo 1: add overall style
todo 2: add checked style when its clicked
todo 3: add localstorage function (list content, data ...etc)
