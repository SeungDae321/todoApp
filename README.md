# todoApp
create list<br>
update list<br>
delete list<br>
no need to make read list because it`s instantly read the created list; <br>(or maybe I should add date info to each list -when was this created && deleted);<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
todo 1: add overall style<br>
todo 2: add checked style when its clicked<br>
todo 3: add localstorage function (list content, data ...etc)<br>
